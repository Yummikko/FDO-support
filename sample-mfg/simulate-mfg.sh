# On a linux VM, simulate the steps a device manufacturer would do:
#   - DI (device initialization)
#   - create the mfg voucher
#   - extend the voucher to the owner (buyer)
#   - switch the device into owner mode

# This script starts/uses the SCT (Supply Chain Tool) services. See the Intel SDO SCT Manufacturer Enablement Guide

usage() {
    exitCode=${1:-0}
    cat << EndOfMessage
Usage: ${0##*/} [<owner-pub-key-file>]

Arguments:
  <owner-pub-key-file>  Device customer/owner public key. This is needed to extend the voucher to the owner. If not specified, it will use SDO-support/keys/sample-owner-key.pub (only valid for dev/test/demo)

Required Environment Variables:
  SDO_RV_URL: usually the dev RV running in the sdo-owner-services. To use the real Intel RV service, set to http://sdo-sbx.trustedservices.intel.com or http://sdo.trustedservices.intel.com and register your public key with Intel.

Optional Environment Variables:
  SDO_MFG_IMAGE_TAG - version of the manufacturer and manufacturer-mariadb docker images that should be used. Defaults to '1.10'.
  HZN_MGMT_HUB_CERT - the base64 encoded content of the SDO owner services self-signed certificate (if it requires that). This is normally not necessary on the device, because the SDO protocols are secure over HTTP.
  SDO_SAMPLE_MFG_KEEP_SVCS - set to 'true' to skip shutting down the mfg docker containers at the end of this script. This is faster if running this script repeatedly during dev/test.
  SDO_SUPPORT_REPO - if you need to use a more recent version of SDO files from the repo than the 1.10 released files. This takes precedence over SDO_SUPPORT_RELEASE.
  SDO_SUPPORT_RELEASE - if you need to use a specific set of released files.
  SDO_DEVICE_USE_NATIVE_CLIENT - Set to 'true' to use the native SDO device client. (To use this, you need to request the 'sdo' native docker image from Intel Developer Zone and load it on this host before running this script.) Otherwise, the reference implementation java device client will be used. 

${0##*/} must be run in a directory where it has access to create a few files and directories.
